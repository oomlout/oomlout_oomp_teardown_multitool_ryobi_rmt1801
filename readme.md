There are 8 plastic clips securing the shell on, try your best to unclip and wedge them open.
### step: 10

Pull the shell apart. This is tricky because the wires are soldered on after the shell is put together. Remove as much solder from the tabs as possible. I couldn't get enough removed so also needed to heat the tabs enough to melt the plastic to force a bigger hole.
